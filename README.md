# PROJECT ONE: ON-BOARDING
Project Description: 
 1. You will create a single-page design that features a sign-up process to get new users to join some type of project, such as an email list, a software beta test, or an open-source community.
 2. The goal of this project is to experiment with
 patterns of interaction that persuade someone to sign up for whatever it is youâ€™re offering, which is not at all an easy task.

Project Goals:
 1. Create a mobile-first responsive web design using two media queries
 2. Apply design principles including typography, color, and material design
 3. Engage in agile, iterative development; documented with at least 20 commits with informative comments
